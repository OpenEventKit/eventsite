Hello! Sponsor ads and logos can link out to any sponsor-related page or back to the sponsor’s virtual sponsor booth page. 

Two samples of virtual sponsor booth layouts are shown below. 

<br />

<div class="columns is-mobile">
  <div class="column is-half">
    TOP-TIER SPONSOR PAGE
    All the bells and whistles: promotional videos and images; scrolling ticker messaging; links to documents, URLs, and social media sites, featured upcoming event  sessions   (hand selected by the sponsor), interactive chat, lead retrieval, meeting scheduling, and more! 
    <br/>
    <img src="./YOCO-GoldSponsor-Page-Mock-960.jpg" alt="TOP-TIER" />
  </div>
  <div class="column is-half">
    MIDDLE-TIER SPONSOR PAGE
    Perhaps a static image header, brief company intro, fewer documents/links, etc. 
    <img src="./YOCO-SilverSponsor-Page-Mock-960.jpg" alt="MIDDLE-TIER" />
  </div>
